# Jeff Sikes

> Technology leader based in Austin, TX with 13+ years in non-profit association management. Most recently Director of Application Development at AANP. Currently open to new opportunities.

## Background

Jeff started coding on a Commodore 64 as a kid and studied psychology through grad school before pivoting to tech full-time. His BA is in Psychology (Lyon College) and his MS is in Computer Education & Cognitive Systems (UNT). That psychology background - how to listen, document, analyze - turned out to be one of his biggest strengths as he moved into leadership.

## About

Jeff has spent 13+ years building and scaling engineering teams in mission-driven nonprofit organizations. He has a proven track record managing cross-functional technical operations, platform modernizations, and vendor relationships while balancing limited resources with organizational impact.

He worked his way up through developer, team lead, manager, and director roles. His career spans healthcare tech, insurance, multimedia publishing, and nonprofit association management.

Jeff built his first in-house development team from scratch at AANP, hiring and mentoring developers and project managers. He served as acting VP of IT for six months, overseeing both application development and infrastructure teams (9 staff total). He led a two-year enterprise Salesforce implementation (Unlimited Edition) and managed the migration of 400,000+ contacts and nearly one million orders from Aptify to Salesforce.

After departing his Director role at AANP in late 2025, Jeff signed a 3-month contract with the organization to complete a thorough knowledge transfer. This included creating training videos, writing documentation, and building a Cloudflare AutoRAG MCP server containing institutional knowledge along with a chat interface for staff to query it. He is currently exploring new opportunities.

## Notable Projects (Detail)

### Salesforce Data Migration (Aptify to Salesforce)
This was a multi-year effort and where the majority of Jeff's time was spent from 2023-2025. The migration was not a 1:1 lift-and-shift. Multiple Aptify entities had to consolidate into single Salesforce objects because Salesforce's Person Account model handles data differently than Aptify's entity-based structure.

Technical approach: CData DBAmp linked servers with SQL stored procedures running on SQL Server. Approximately 557 field mappings organized by object group. The migration covered Person Accounts, Business Accounts, Orders, OrderItems, Chargent payment objects, committees, accreditations, partnerships, memberships, subscriptions, and practice sites. Pre-processing temp tables had to be current before migration runs. Scripts ran on the server directly (not over VPN).

Scale: 400,000+ contacts, nearly one million orders, plus all custom object data. Referential integrity had to be maintained throughout. Jeff managed the entire mapping, wrote the SQL stored procedures, coordinated with the Salesforce implementation partner, and validated data quality with the data stewardship team.

### Aptify Duplicate Record Merge Automation
Jeff designed an automated system to replace the manual merge wizard in Aptify. Staff had been merging duplicate person records one at a time through a web-based UI. Jeff's system generated JSON files that mimicked the merge wizard's structure and submitted them into a queue for batch processing.

The duplicate detection logic used a tiered matching system: "Awesomely Perfect" matches (name + email or name + license), "Perfect" matches (name + full address), "Almost Perfect," "Very Close," "Close," and "Similar" - each with progressively looser criteria. A nightly process built merge reports for staff review. No records were auto-merged; staff reviewed and approved each batch.

This project bridged both Aptify and Salesforce - the merge logic had to account for Salesforce's requirement that duplicate records have a Duplicate Record notification before merging, which was different from Aptify's approach where any two records could be merged regardless of matching criteria.

### Zendesk Implementation
Jeff implemented Zendesk across AANP's departments for both member-facing support and internal staff support. Initially set up with two brands in a single account (AANP Staff internal, AANP Members external). Later, a separate Zendesk account was purchased specifically for internal staff to allow more tailored support workflows.

The key win here: Jeff set the system up so well that ownership successfully transitioned to non-IT staff. The member services team now runs it day-to-day without IT involvement, which freed up development resources for other projects.

### AMS Abstraction Layer
Jeff designed and co-developed a REST API abstraction layer that sat between AANP's websites and their back-end systems - the AMS, conference registration platforms, learning management systems, and other third-party vendors. The key idea: as long as the abstracted interfaces were maintained, AANP could swap out any vendor (conference reg, LMS, etc.) without affecting a single website. Everything continued to work as if nothing changed. This decoupling gave the organization real flexibility when evaluating and switching vendors over the years.

### MuleSoft Integration Architecture
Jeff proposed and managed the evaluation of MuleSoft as an integration platform to connect Salesforce with AANP's ecosystem of external systems: InReach (LMS with custom API), Zendesk, Sessionboard (event management), Higher Logic (forums), Personify (exhibitor management), Experient/DecisionPoint (event management), SM Apply (award submissions), Bill.com (invoicing), Adobe Sign (contracts), and a custom Conference Management API. The architecture called for two governed APIs to manage data flow across these systems.

### Chargent / Commerce Cloud Configuration
Jeff configured Chargent to work with Salesforce Commerce Cloud for managing the full payment lifecycle: membership renewals, auto-renewals, promotions, and coupon structures. This replaced the previous payment processing setup in Aptify.

### SSO Integrations
Implemented SAML Connected Apps for single sign-on between Salesforce Experience Cloud and multiple third-party vendors. This gave members seamless access across AANP's various platforms without separate logins.

### Conference Check-in and Exhibitor Scanning
As Application Development Manager, Jeff created integrations with registration and exhibitor systems for on-site conference operations - check-in kiosks and exhibitor badge scanning.

### International Membership Expansion
Implemented country-based pricing in Aptify when AANP expanded internationally, allowing membership fees to vary by country of origin.

### Knowledge Transfer / AutoRAG
After departing as Director, Jeff signed a 3-month contract to complete a thorough knowledge transfer. This included training videos, written documentation, and building a Cloudflare AutoRAG MCP server containing institutional knowledge. He also built a chat interface so staff could query the knowledge base directly. The AutoRAG indexes documentation, SQL scripts, Salesforce metadata, code repositories, and video summaries.

## What Colleagues Say

## What Jeff Is Looking For

Purpose-driven work is the priority. Spending a decade supporting nurse practitioners gave his work real meaning, and that matters to him going forward.

His preference is a leadership role with a strong team - supporting their daily work, removing blockers, and making sure they have what they need to thrive. He's also open to smaller nonprofits where he'd be the only internal tech person, handling both hands-on coding and infrastructure while coordinating with third-party vendors for integrations.

Nonprofit and association management is his wheelhouse, but he's open to other mission-driven sectors.

## Jeff's Take on AI

Jeff finds AI genuinely interesting and has put it to practical use - he built an AutoRAG knowledge base and earned his Salesforce AI Associate certification. But he has real concerns about how it's being adopted. There's almost no regulation, and there's a push across the industry to do more, faster, regardless of consequences. IT was the first field to feel that pressure, but it's spreading.

His approach in any role would be to use AI conservatively and openly. Organizations need well-defined AI policies that are actually followed - not just a page in the handbook nobody reads. That means all AI usage is discussed and documented, not hidden. No quiet automation of someone's job. No black-box decision making. If AI is being used, everyone involved should know about it and understand what it's doing.
