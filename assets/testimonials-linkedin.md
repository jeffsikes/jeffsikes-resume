## Meredith L White
- **Title:** AVP, Implementations Services at Cotiviti Healthcare
- **Date:** June 11, 2012
- **Relationship:** Meredith L managed Jeff directly

Jeff is a gifted developer. In the past six years he has reported to me he continuously delivers applications that not only astound the users but provide functionality that exceeds expectations. I believe this is not only due to his talent as a developer but also with willingness to work with the end user to determine the most appropriate approach for the product. Asking questions and listening to the user is integral in the development of our web based applications and Jeff does not make assumptions.

When given a project, he will always take the time to analyze the request and provide recommendations for the best approach to development. He looks at the big picture and what the possible future impact of the change will have on other applications or users.

It has been my pleasure to have the opportunity to work with Jeff and know he will be a great asset to any organization.
